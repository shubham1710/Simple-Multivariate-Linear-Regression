# Simple-Multivariate-Linear-Regression-using-numpy
We will see how to start with linear regression. We will be doing multivariate linear regression using Numpy and will try to make predictions. We will be using Normal Equation method for our purpose here.


This project includes the code, the datasets for training and the output dataset when run on the training set. 

We have 4 different parameters here. The parameters here are for a shopping company and we have to predict the amount spent by the customer based on four parameters.
